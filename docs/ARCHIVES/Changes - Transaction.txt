3.3.x
==============

- Upgraded libraries to Core 3.3.0 and Windsor 3.3.0


2.5.0 (2010-12-10)
==================

Included NET40 binaries on the release package

Fixed: Behavior of Nested/Ambient Transactions from the expected behavior (SERVICES-24)
Fixed: Transaction Synchronizations not been executed when registered in NestedTransaction (SERVICES-21)

Breaking Change: Renamed the property RollbackResourceException.FailedResource to RollbackResourceException.FailedResources

2010-09-23, 2.1 (non-release)
=============================
* Made all tests run in STA in order to pass nunit tests more reliably.
* Updated Settings.proj to have the 2.1.0 version.
* Committed myself to committers.
* Restructured sln-files, so that we have one for only .Transaction, one with .F.AutoTX and one with both.

Roadmap to 2.6:
* Will remove all locking from transactions will next version and instead assume non-concurrent access to a transaction instance
  from multiple threads (one transaction per thread is the scenario we are supporting; everything else is racy)
* Will add code contracts to the transaction classes
* Next batch of changes will probably include some sort of
  improvement on the retry-policies of the transaction, should they collide like they do in tests running concurrently.

==========
Henrik: Updated folder structure to match that of John's suggestions. ClickToBuild.cmd now works after fix from Krzysztof/John. Previously
it didn't work for directories with spaces in them.

Somewhere in between these dates:
=================================
Updated to fix a bug, as per the commit message, caused by incorrect disposal of transactions. Remade the AbstractTransaction into BaseTransaction
and changed the public API quite a lot.

2010-02-28
==========
Henrik: Cloned from git repository, going to modify so that it compiles. Moved sln files to src dir.
Added functionality in terms of a managed implementation of the transactional file system. More information
is available to the web site and on the mailing list.
